**P5_JAVA**
----------



Moving to IntelliJ IDEA CC as my primary Processing IDE.  Rethinking my workflow to keep Sublime and IDE in the mix, but IDEA will be king.

This repo will contain Processing sketches all written in java.  For the time being, the top level folders will be the root folder of an IntelliJ project.  In each project folder you will find a folder named src.  All sketches live in a subfolder under src.  

Take care and luck!
